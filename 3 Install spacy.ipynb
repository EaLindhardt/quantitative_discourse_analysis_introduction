    "When working with text it is convenient to use some language tools in your analysis'. spaCy is such a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy is an open-source natural language processing (NLP) library for Python. It is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use for various NLP tasks. spaCy provides pre-trained language models and a wide range of tools and features for working with text data, making it a popular choice for NLP tasks in research and industry applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key features and use cases of spaCy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenization: spaCy can segment text into words, punctuation, and other meaningful tokens. It can handle complex tokenization tasks, including splitting contractions and handling special cases like hyphenated words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part-of-Speech Tagging: It can assign parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each token in a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Named Entity Recognition (NER): spaCy can identify and classify named entities in text, such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dependency Parsing: It can analyze the grammatical structure of a sentence by identifying the relationships between words and their dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lemmatization: spaCy can convert words to their base or dictionary forms (lemmas). For example, it can transform \"running\" to \"run\" and \"better\" to \"good.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text Classification: It supports text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis and topic classification, using machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Entity Linking: It can link named entities in the text to external knowledge bases or databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training Custom Models: You can train custom models using spaCy, which allows you to create models for specific languages or domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy is known for its performance and efficiency, making it suitable for both small-scale NLP tasks and large-scale text processing applications. It supports multiple languages and has a rich ecosystem of extensions and third-party packages to enhance its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not cover it all, but use some functionality from spacy throughout the course. You can read more about spaCy here: https://spacy.io/"
